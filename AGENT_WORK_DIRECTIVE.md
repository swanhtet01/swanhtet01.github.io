## üîÑ **IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIZATION**

Use this scoring system for all improvements:

### **Impact Score (1-10):**
- User satisfaction improvement
- Time/effort savings for users
- Competitive differentiation
- Revenue potential

### **Effort Score (1-10):**
- Development complexity
- Resource requirements
- Timeline to completion
- Risk factors

### **Priority Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Impact Score √ó 2) - Effort Score
High Priority: Score > 12
Medium Priority: Score 8-12  
Low Priority: Score < 8
```
