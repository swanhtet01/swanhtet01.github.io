## üìà Scaling Cost Analysis

### CPU & Memory Impact on Costs

**Key Insight:** AWS pricing is **linear** - more CPU/RAM = proportionally higher cost.

| Resource Doubling | Cost Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **2x vCPUs** | +100% instance cost |
| **2x RAM** | +100% instance cost |
| **2x Storage** | +100% storage cost |
| **2x Traffic** | +variable data transfer cost |

### Auto-Scaling Cost Example
```
Base: t3.large @ $59.90/month (24/7)

During Peak Hours (8 hours/day):
+ 2 additional t3.large instances
+ Cost: 2 √ó $59.90 √ó (8/24) = $39.93/month

Total with Auto-Scaling: $99.83/month
```
