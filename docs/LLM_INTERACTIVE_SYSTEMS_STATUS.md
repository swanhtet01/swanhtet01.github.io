        self.conversation_history = {}
    
    async def generate_response(self, user_message, context=None):
        # Real LLM integration implementation
        pass
    
    def save_conversation(self, session_id, messages):
        # Database persistence implementation
        pass
```

### 5.2 Enhanced Chat Interface Features
```javascript
// Add to agent_chat.html
class EnhancedChatManager {

        this.conversationHistory = [];
        this.contextMemory = new Map();
    }
    
    async sendMessageWithContext(message) {
        // Enhanced message handling with context
    }
    
    saveConversationHistory() {
        // Local storage and server sync
    }
}
```
