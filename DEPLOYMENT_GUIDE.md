   ```

2. **Set your OpenAI API key** (edit in `launch_enhanced_agents.py`):
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Launch locally:**
   ```bash
   python launch_enhanced_agents.py
   ```

4. **Access the system:**
   - Chat Interface: http://localhost:5000
   - API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/chat
   - Health Check: http://localhost:5000/health

### Option 2: AWS EC2 Deployment (Production)

1. **Configure AWS credentials** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Update security groups** in `deploy_enhanced_agents.py`:
   - Create a security group allowing port 5000
   - Update the `SecurityGroupIds` parameter

3. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   python deploy_enhanced_agents.py
   ```

4. **Enter your OpenAI API key** when prompted

5. **Access via EC2 public IP:**
   - Chat Interface: http://YOUR-EC2-IP:5000
   - Monitor in AWS CloudWatch
