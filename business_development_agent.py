Quick question - are you spending too much time or money on lead generation at {lead['company']}?

I noticed that {lead['industry'].lower()} professionals often struggle with {lead['pain_point'].lower()}.

I have AI tools that can find 500 qualified leads (with contact info) in 48 hours for $500.

For {lead['company']}:
{lead['value_proposition']}

Budget range: {lead['budget_range']} (you'd pay just $500 once)

Interested in seeing a sample of 20 leads for your industry (free)?

Takes me 10 minutes to generate, could save you hours of research.

Let me know!
