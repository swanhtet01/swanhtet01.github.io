# SuperMega Platform Deployment

## User Platform (Public) 
- **URL**: https://swanhtet01.github.io (GitHub Pages)
- **Purpose**: User-facing platform with login, contact forms, and suite selection
- **Features**: Three professional AI suites (Creative, Analyst, Manager)

## Internal AWS Dashboard (Private)
- **URL**: https://supermega.dev/platform.html (Internal use only)
- **Purpose**: AWS agent monitoring and internal development tools
- **Access**: Development team and internal operations only

## Platform Separation
- ✅ User platform no longer routes to internal dashboard
- ✅ Login and contact forms implemented
- ✅ Professional three-suite design (Creative, Analyst, Manager)
- ✅ GitHub Pages optimized for main branch deployment

## Next Steps
1. User platform is ready for GitHub Pages deployment
2. Internal AWS tools remain separate at supermega.dev
3. Contact: swanhtet@supermega.dev for user onboarding
