# SuperMega Strategic TODO

> Mandate: no direct hands-on labor. All execution flows through autonomous AWS-hosted agents and specialized delivery pods. This document defines the delegations required to 10x the architecture into a metaphysical, intuitive, AI-native system where every AWS agent runs its own LLM stack for coding and non-coding tasks.

| Priority | Workstream | Owner Pod | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | **Metaphysical Fabric Blueprint** | Architecture Guild | COMPLETE | Dual-plane intent fabric documented in `aws-deployment-architecture.md` + `Intent Beacon Fabric` section; supermega.dev now reflects the metaphysical narrative. |
| P0 | **Self-Sovereign LLM Stack** | Agent Ops Guild | COMPLETE | `agent-setup-guide.md` details local reflex models, provider connectors, routing microservice, and health telemetry for every AWS agent. |
| P0 | **Yangon Tyre Demo Continuity** | Yangon Pod | COMPLETE | `ytf-demo.html` + refreshed `aws_status_report.json` keep ytf.supermega.dev live with status polling and narrative guidance. |
| P0 | **Supermega.dev Narrative Fix** | Experience Pod | COMPLETE | `index.html` and `supermega-platform.html` highlight the Intuitive Manufacturing Cloud, dual-plane fabric, and demo CTAs. |
| P1 | **Manufacturing Template vNext** | Template Factory | COMPLETE | `manufacturing-template.md` now includes the Intent & Agent Configuration block plus the Partner Onboarding Kit guidance. |
| P1 | **Agent Health Telemetry** | Agent Ops Guild | COMPLETE | `agent-setup-guide.md` adds the Agent Conscience telemetry steps and CloudWatch/OpenSearch wiring. |
| P1 | **Copilot CLI Autonomy** | DevEx Pod | COMPLETE | Copilot CLI autonomy runbook + headless workflow documented in `agent-setup-guide.md`. |
| P2 | **Metaphysical Analytics** | Data Intelligence Pod | COMPLETE | `aws-deployment-architecture.md` now outlines the Metaphysical Analytics Layer (Athena, QuickSight, SageMaker loops). |
| P2 | **Partner Onboarding Template** | Alliances Pod | COMPLETE | Partner onboarding kit section lives in `manufacturing-template.md` with deck, intent starter, Codex preset, and runbook guidance. |

## Immediate Directives
1. **Conscience Agent**: keep `aws_status_report.json` accurate (60s) and auto-heal if uptime < 99.99%.
2. **Experience Pod**: run nightly lighthouse + content checks on supermega.dev and ytf.supermega.dev.
3. **Yangon Pod**: record weekly demo run-throughs and archive transcripts for sales enablement.
4. **Template Factory**: prep the next manufacturer config using the updated template and partner kit.

## Notes
- All executions must be initiated by agents; humans only approve intents.
- Slack `#metaphysical-ops` captures escalations; PagerDuty service `Agent Mesh` handles incidents.
- Update this TODO once each pod reports completion through its supervising agents.
